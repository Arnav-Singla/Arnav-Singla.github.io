            Since 1970, Parisian magic has operated continuously in the west of the capital, at the Parc des Princes. In a few decades, Paris Saint-Germain has become a benchmark in the French sports panorama at high speed. During its first 41 years of a flourishing existence, the club stamped "Made in Paris" won 18 trophies including a European title in 1996.

        <p>
            Become a benchmark, the institution will then marry an exponential curve, in 2011, with Qatar Sports Investments in the maneuver. A new era has begun, it will unquestionably combine successfully.

            The facts are clear: since then, Paris has imprinted its status as a global city on all fronts. And if elegance, respect too, are engraved in the DNA of the megalopolis, these attributes now transpire from its ambassadors, decked out in red and blue. A particularism which now applies to the plural, in a triptych.

            Men's football, women's football and handball: the coat of arms today aims to unite and above all drive an XXL project.

        <h4>Global Brand</h4><br>
        <p>
            At a time of globalization, Paris Saint-Germain 2.0 wants to be multidisciplinary, also transversal, to intensify its brilliance. It is unique in France: a pennant has expressly changed into a global brand, carried successively by VIPs (Very important Parisians) such as Beckham, Neymar Jr, Kylian Mbappé, Nadia Nadim or Karabatic. The bet is successful, it is unprecedented.

        <p>
            A vector of communication and open in essence to the international arena, the capital's club will use this dynamic to capitalize. The course is set - win - and the trophy room will materialize it. In just 8 years, the men's team reached 22 titles in August 2019 and is therefore in “pole position” of the most sacred clubs on the national scene.
        </p><br>
        <p>
            From 2014 to 2016, the Parisian "dream team" even won a second quadruple in rank in France, an unequaled performance in the 5 major European championships.
        </p><br>
        <p>
            On all floors, this thirst for titles is palpable, obvious. The women, winners of the 2018 Coupe de France, shared the continental dream twice, reaching the final of the Champions League in 2015 and 2017. On the floor and 7 to 7, the situation is similar: bosses of handball at the French, Parisians want to duplicate this hegemony in the most prestigious of competitions.

            The “Experts” of Paris Saint-Germain know on the tip of their nails the way to be traced: it goes through Cologne - the temple of discipline - which crowns the European cador every year, at the end of an EHF Final 4 Champions League of all excess. As a regular visitor, Paris will definitely want to shine its domestic colors there.
